In the last week, we landed 26 PRs.

###Notable additions

 - Josh [implemented basic support for form controls](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3520). We have working checkboxes and radio buttons now, with [text input](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3585) and form submission coming soon.
 - Patrick [fixed the hypothetical box behavior for `position:absolute` elements with `display:inline`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3546)
 - Tim Taubert added support for [wildcard namespace selectors for attributes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3584)
 - Manish [purged `Traceable` and `Untraceable`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3518) since we can now directly implement `JSTraceable`. Types can be marked as untraceable using the `untraceable!` macro.
 - Gilles [added namespace support to `HTML*Element::new()`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3575), fixing `createElementNS()`
 - Ms2ger [replaced `page.fragment_node` with `page.fragment_name`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3558)
 - Simon [added better handling of runtime-loaded files and used it to load the user agent CSS at runtime](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3601). Cargo can create binaries in different locations depending on the type of build, this lets us load resources at runtime without needing to repeatedly deal with this.
