Nightly builds of the Servo web rendering engine are now available. To make
the Servo engine easy to interact with, we are bundling an HTML-based browser
UI. While our engine is not yet fully web compatible, we want to give a larger
audience the chance to start experimenting with and contributing to Servo. We
have created packages for macOS and Linux; Windows and Android packages should
be available soon.

Binary packages and installation instructions are available at
[download.servo.org](http://download.servo.org/index.html).

When you first run Servo, you see a new tab page containing a selection of
sites that Servo renders well and some tech demos. A
[stand-alone copy of this page](https://servo.org/bhtml-newtab/newtab.html) is
available for use in other browsers to compare performance.

## Getting involved

Servo is a community project
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/servo/servo/), and we have a
[curated list of good first bugs](https://starters.servo.org/) for you,
whether you're interested in writing Rust, JS, Python, or even shell
scripts. If you are a web developer, we’d love to see what you can do with
Servo’s capabilities.

If you encounter any problems we’d love to hear about them in
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues).
