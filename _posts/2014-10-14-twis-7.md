(This is only a half week, I'm switching from posting on Thursday to Monday/Tuesday, so that the posts come just after the meeting)

Since the last post, we landed 16 PRs.

###Notable additions

 - Glenn [exposed the command-line supplied user agent through `navigator.userAgent`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3608). Many sites break when they look for this property, not anymore.
 - Patrick [tweaked `box-sizing` to not affect automatically computed sizes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3615)
 - Clark pushed [a portion of his incremental style recalc work](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3590)
 - Manish [implemented basic form submission](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3642) via `<form>.submit()`
 - Matt [moved more windowing code out of the compositor](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3563)

###Screenshots

[This](http://i.imgur.com/ovsAgSu.gif) is how Google Search behaves in Servo, with the current work on forms. It includes:

 - Josh's [merged work on form controls](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3520)
 - Manish's [merged work on form submission](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3642)
 - [This pull request on submit buttons](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3652) by Manish and Rohan
 - Josh's [pull request on text input](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3585)

You can find these changes applied in order [here](https://github.com/Manishearth/servo/compare/rebased-input), if you want to try it out.

###Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-10-13)

 - There's going to be a Servo-themed Rust meetup during the November work week! November 6, Mozilla SF office.
 - WPT is getting flaky again, in a heisenbug-esque fashion.
 - html5ever should land soon. It might be possible to extend it for XML5 (which uses an HTML parsing algorithm)
 - Incremental reflow is coming bit by bit, but it's gated behind a flag since the current partial implementation breaks tests
 - November will have our biggest work week till date! (21 people) We discussed the agenda for a bit.
