In the past three weeks, we merged 170 pull requests

[html5ever][] celebrated its first birthday! Keegan published a [project update][] with some plans for the future.

Servo has another browser chrome! Say hello to [servo-shell](https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell),
    an interface written with HTML, leveraging the 
    [`mozbrowser` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Using_the_Browser_API).
    Try it out!


Keegan's working on some interesting new stuff on the string front.
    Check out [tendril](https://github.com/kmcallister/tendril#tendril), a multitalented string type!

###Notable additions

- We landed a [Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5256)
- Glenn [implemented a subset of the mozbrowser APIs](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5281) 
    and used these to make [servo-shell](https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell) work. This required
    [a](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5205) [ton](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5205)
    [of](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5205) [iframe](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5249)
    [fixes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5248).
- Patrick implemented [CSS transitions](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5400)
- Keegan pushed a [rebased, remixed version][pr114] of Clark's [zero-copy
  html5ever patch][pr60]. With this PR, html5ever can locate tags and
  attributes in an input stream at 80 MB/s while keeping whole-process memory
  consumption to a few MB. Design work is [already
  underway](https://github.com/kmcallister/tendril) for the next iteration of
  the zero-copy string type.
- Nicholas [added support for fine-grained memory reporting](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5193), 
    along with a [tree-like prettified output](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5284)
- Chris Paris landed `innerHTML` [getter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5029)
  and [setter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4888) implementations that use
  html5ever.
- Mátyás added [stroke](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5302) and [`arc()`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5185)
    support to canvas, along  with many other APIs
- Diego implemented [the `drawImage` API for canvas](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5231)
- Matt McCoy [added support for HTTP compression](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5299)
- Yodalee [implemented `TextEncoder](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5469)
- Sebastian [implemented `StorageEvent`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5306)
- Zack added [a shim for `localStorage`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5217)
- Ms2ger implemented [a safer replacement for `Vec<Root<T>>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5436)
- Manishearth added support for [simple userscripts](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5298)
- Jack fixed a [memory leak in the flowtree](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5228)
- hsavala made console.log messages [appear in remote Firefox consoles](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5229)
- Tetsuharu added support for [unrestricted floating point WebIDL values](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5346)
- Thiago implemented partial support for [interacting with worker globals via remote devtools](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5181)

###Meetings

[Notes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-03-16) from the meeting on March 16th.

 - We build nightly APK builds for Android now. They're not yet functional though.
 - We discussed how to proceed with respect to performance testing
 - We discussed some important features we're missing in both DOM and layout, and how to focus on usability, if at all

[Notes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-03-30) from the meeting on March 30th

 - Everyone's working out their goals for the second quarter
 - Can we sandbox the experimental APIs so that we can run servo-shell without giving content access to the APIs?
