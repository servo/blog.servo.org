In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-09-19..2016-09-26+user%3Aservo), we landed 96 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Promise support has [arrived](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12830) in Servo, thanks to hard work by jdm, dati91, and mmatyas! This does not fully implement microtasks, but unblocks the uses of Promises in many places (e.g., the WebBluetooth test suite).

Emilio [rewrote](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen/pull/37) the bindings generation code for rust-bindgen, dramatically improving the flow of the code and output generated when producing Rust bindings for C and C++ code.

The TPAC WebBluetooth [standards meeting](https://youtu.be/Vty9FsTTOoI?t=10m34s) talked a bit about the great [progress](http://szeged.github.io/servo/) by the team at the University of Szeged in the context of Servo.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the Q3 plans. The Q4 and 2017 planning will begin shortly!

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo). We have been having a [conversation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/lPCp-3_Of4Q) on the mailing list about how to better involve all contributors to the Servo project and especially improve the visibility into upcoming work - please make your ideas and opinions known!
