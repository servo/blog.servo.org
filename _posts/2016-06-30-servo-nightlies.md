Today the Servo team is making available nightly builds of the Servo web
rendering engine. To make the Servo engine easy to interact with, we are
bundling an HTML-based browser UI. While our engine is not yet web compatible,
we want to give a larger audience the chance to start experimenting with and
contributing to Servo. We have created packages for macOS and Linux; Windows
and Android packages should be available soon.

## Getting started

Binary packages and installation instructions are available at
[download.servo.org](http://download.servo.org/index.html).

When you first run Servo, you see a new tab page containing a selection of
sites that Servo renders well and some tech demos. A
[stand-alone copy of this page](https://servo.org/bhtml-newtab/newtab.html) is
available for use in other browsers to compare performance.

## Getting involved

Servo is a community project
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/servo/servo/), and we have a
[curated list of good first bugs](https://starters.servo.org/) for people,
whether they are interested in writing Rust, JS, Python, or even shell
scripts. Furthermore, if you encounter any problems weâ€™d love to hear about
them in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues).
