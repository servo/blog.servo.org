In the past two weeks, we merged 73 pull requests.


We have a new member on our team. Please welcome [Emily Dunham][edunham]!
Emily will be the DevOps engineer for both Servo and Rust.
She has [a post about her ideas regarding open infrastructure][edunham-ops] which
is worth reading.


Josh [discussed Servo and Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SfA1sw7vY) at a programming talk show hosted by Alexander Putilin.

We have an impending [upgrade of the SpiderMonkey Javascript engine] by Michael Wu. This moves us from a very old spidermonkey to a recent-ish one. Naturally, the team is quite excited about the prospect
of getting rid of all the old bugs and getting shiny new ones in their place.

###Notable additions
 - We landed a [tiny Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6151) that caused a lot of trouble for its size. Shortly after, we landed [another tiny one](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6155) that brought us to 1.2.0
 - Corey [found a bug in `rust-url`](https://github.com/servo/rust-url/pull/108) using [afl.rs](https://github.com/kmcallister/afl.rs), a fuzzer for Rust by Keegan. It's had quite a few success stories so far, try it out on your own project!
 - Patrick [improved support for incremental reflow](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6124)
 - Glenn [fixed our Android build](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6109) after a long bout of brokenness
 - Lars and Mike [bravely fought the Cargo.lock beast and won; in an epic battle of man vs machine](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6125). [There even was a sequel!](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6175)
 - Patrick [implemented per-glyph font fallback](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5607)
 - Keith [started work on the `fetch` module](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6129)
 - Jinwoo added support for CSS [`background-origin`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6046), [`background-clip`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6067), [`padding-box` and `box-sizing`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6033)
 - Anthony [cleaned up our usages of `RootedVec`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6140)
 - Patrick [made our reflowing more in line with what Gecko does](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6028)
 - Glenn [fixed a bunch of race conditions with reftests and the compositor](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6031)
 - James [improved our web platform tests integration to allow for upstreaming binary changes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6036)

###Meetings

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-05-18)

 - We discussed forking or committing to maintaining the extensions we need in glutin. Glutin is trying to stay focused and "not become a toolkit", but there are some changes we need in it for embedding. Currently we have some changes on our fork; but we'd prefer to not use tweaked forks for community-maintained dependencies and were exploring the possibilities.
 - Mike is back and working on more embedding!
 - There was some planning for the Rust-in-Gecko sessions at Whistler
 - RTL is coming!
