In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-01-04..2016-01-11+user%3Aservo), we landed 76 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We are very excited to announce that we've [added](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/188) three new reviewers this week! Ravi Shankar ([waffles](https://github.com/wafflespeanut)), Emilio Cobos Álvares ([emiliocobos](https://github.com/ecoal95/)), and Keith Yeung ([KiChjang](https://github.com/KiChjang)) have all be contributing and commenting on PRs for quite a while now, and we're glad to have them onboard as reviewers. This brings Servo to 23 reviewers, 12 of whom are not employed by Mozilla!

With the start of 2016, we've [updated](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) Servo's roadmap. You can also [see](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/Servo-Q1-2016) our team Q1 goal planning in progress. 2016 looks to be a very exciting year for the project!

###Notable Additions

- bholley [landed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/9209) a `geckolib` target, which is basically a subset of Servo's style system for reuse in Gecko
- nox [enabled](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/2665) a ton more tests by fixing up the proto chains of interface objects
- gsnedders [enabled](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8565) even more CSS module tests
