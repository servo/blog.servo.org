In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-09-27..2015-10-05+user%3Aservo),
we landed 69 PRs in the Servo repository!

Glenn wrote a short [report](https://github.com/glennw/webrender/wiki) on how webrender is coming
along. Webrender is a new renderer for Servo which is specialized for web content. The initial
results are quite promising!

###Notable additions

 - Patrick and Corey  reduced allocator churn [in our DOMstring code](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7765) [and string joining code](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7776)
 - Josh [restyled `<select>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7847) so that `<select multiple>` works.
 - Vladimir's [Windows](https://github.com/servo/rust-layers/pull/209) [work](https://github.com/ecoal95/angle/pull/1) [continues](https://github.com/ecoal95/rust-offscreen-rendering-context/pull/30/)
 - Corey [implemented `<font size>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7683)
 - Martin [simplified our stacking context creation code](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7804)

###Meetings

At last week's [meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-09-28), we discussed
[webrender](https://github.com/glennw/webrender), and pulling app units out into a separate crate.
