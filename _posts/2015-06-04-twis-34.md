We are welcoming new intern Colin and returning intern Laleh!

Mike Blumenkrantz blogged about embedding Servo on the Samsung OSG blog:
[*Servo: The Countdown To Your Next Browser Continues*][embedding].

Nicholas Nethercote explored the measurement of data structure sizes in Servo
and Firefox in
[*Measuring data structure sizes: Firefox (C++) vs. Servo (Rust)*][sizeof].

In older news, Manish wrote
[*The Problem With Single-threaded Shared Mutability*][mut] and a video of
[Josh's *Servo (the parallel web browser) and YOU!* talk][fosdem] at this
year's FOSDEM conference became available.
