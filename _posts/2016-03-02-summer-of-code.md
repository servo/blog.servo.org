This summer, [Servo][servo] is participating in both [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] and 
[Rails Girls Summer of Code][rgsoc].

If you're a student with a passion for open source and want to work on a 3-month mentored Rust
project in Servo (with a stipend), consider applying!

The Rails Girls Summer of Code project ideas can be found [here][rgsoc-servo], and the Google Summer
of Code ideas are [here][gsoc-servo]. Applications need not be confined to these ideas; if you have
something else you want to work on let us know.

Feel free to ask question on the #servo IRC channel on [irc.mozilla.org][irc], or email us at
josh@joshmatthews.net or manishearth@gmail.com.


_If you're interested in Rust there are [some][rgsoc-nom] [other][gsoc-ubuntu] Rust projects out
there too._
