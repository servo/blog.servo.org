In the past three weeks, we merged 170 pull requests.

Servo has another browser chrome! Say hello to [servo-shell](https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell),
an interface written with HTML, leveraging the
[`mozbrowser` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Using_the_Browser_API).

[Try it out](https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell#how-do-i-use-it)! At the most recent meeting, we discussed making this the default UI for `./mach run`.

[html5ever][] celebrated its first birthday! Keegan published a [project update][] with some plans for the future.
h5e's newest sibling is [tendril](https://github.com/kmcallister/tendril#readme), a multitalented string type!

If your favorite website looks wrong in Servo, you can help us figure out why! Glenn wrote up a detailed guide on [getting started working on Servo's layout code](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Getting-started-with-layout), with some useful tips for minimizing test cases. We are also working on automatic minimization via "[abstract reftests](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/5260)".

###Notable additions

- We landed a [Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5256)
- Glenn [implemented a subset of the mozbrowser APIs](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5281) 
    and used these to make [servo-shell](https://github.com/glennw/servo-shell) work. This required
    [a](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5205) [ton](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5205)
    [of](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5205) [iframe](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5249)
    [fixes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5248).
- Patrick implemented [CSS transitions](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5400)
- Keegan pushed a [rebased, remixed version][pr114] of Clark's [zero-copy
  html5ever patch][pr60]. With this PR, html5ever can locate tags and
  attributes in an input stream at 80 MB/s while keeping whole-process memory
  consumption to a few MB.
- Nicholas [added support for fine-grained memory reporting](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5193), 
    along with a [tree-like prettified output](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5284)
- Chris Paris landed `innerHTML` [getter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5029)
  and [setter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4888) implementations that use
  html5ever.
- Mátyás added [stroke](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5302) and [`arc()`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5185)
    support to canvas, along  with many other APIs
- Diego implemented [the `drawImage` API for canvas](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5231)
- Matt McCoy [added support for HTTP compression](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5299)
- Yodalee [implemented `TextEncoder`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5469)
- Sebastian [implemented `StorageEvent`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5306)
- Zack added [a shim for `localStorage`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5217)
- Ms2ger implemented [a safer replacement for `Vec<Root<T>>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5436)
- Manishearth added support for [simple userscripts](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5298)
- Jack fixed a [memory leak in the flowtree](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5228)
- hsavala made console.log messages [appear in remote Firefox consoles](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5229)
- Tetsuharu added support for [unrestricted floating point WebIDL values](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5346)
- Thiago implemented partial support for [interacting with worker globals via remote devtools](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5181)

###Screenshots

The colored boxes indicate which CPU core performed layout for each document node. The box
around the active tab spinner is askew, because the spinner is a still image styled with
[`transform: rotate(...)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transforms).

###Meetings

We had meetings on [March
16th](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-03-16) and [March
30th](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-03-30). We discussed
servo-shell, getting the PR queue under control, and restricting non-standard
APIs like `<iframe mozbrowser>`. We also talked about the status of Servo on
Android; there are now "nightly" APK builds but they [don't work
yet](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/5145).

We've had a lot of discussions recently about the project's goals and plans for
Q2. After months of landing new features at an incredible rate, Q2 is going to
focus more on details: performance improvements, fixing compatibility bugs, and
paying down technical debt. We'd like to find websites / create demos that
showcase Servo's advantages in a way that's relevant to users.

We're also going to work on security. This means finding and fixing issues, but
also documenting what we don't fix yet. Josh is going to upgrade our ancient
version of SpiderMonkey, which is important for security and for the future of
Servo in general.
