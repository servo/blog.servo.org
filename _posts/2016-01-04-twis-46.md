In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-12-28..2016-01-04+user%3Aservo), we landed 61 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories. Given the New Year, the number of people out on vacation, and the repeated Linode DDOS events, it's amazing that so many things landed! Great work, all.

This week, edunham [moved](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/183) us onto our own EC2 account for our CI, which will bring us both more reliability (our automation was "fighting" for instances with another team's) and allowed us to remove some of most expensive fallback instances.

###Notable Additions

- Simon [renamed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/9086) the `rust-snapshot-hash` file to `rust-nightly-date`
- larsberg [fixed](https://github.com/servo/blog.servo.org/pull/51) the long-broken TWiS RSS feed
- ckimes [added](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/9122) an input event for `HTMLInputElement`
- jdm [made](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8109) button elements activateable, fixing reddit and github 2fa issues
- bholley [split](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/9051) the layout wrappers up more, in support of the Stylo work
