This week, we merged 60 pull requests.


Selector matching has been extracted into an independent library! You can see it [here](https://github.com/servo/rust-selectors).

We now have automation set up for our Gonk (Firefox OS) port, and gate on it.


###Notable additions

 - Chris Paris landed [fragment parsing in html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever/pull/91)
   and implemented the [innerHTML setter in Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4888).
 - Jack Moffitt added a [visualization](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4969) of parallelization in effect when rendering pages.
 - Manish and Lars [added `./mach build-gonk` to automate building for Firefox OS](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4991)
 - Edit Balint implemented [canvas pixel manipulation](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5020).
 - Nick Nethercote improved the state of [memory profiling](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4894) on Linux.
 - Simon Sapin extracted CSS selector matching into an [independent library](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5010).

###Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-02-23)

 - Rust in Gecko: We're slowly figuring out what we need to do (and have a [tracking bug](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-02-23)). Some more candidates for a Rust component in Gecko are an MP4 demultiplexer, and a replacement of safe browsing code.
 - Selector matching is now in a new library
 - `./mach build-gonk` works. At the moment it needs a build of B2G, which is huge (and requires a device), but we're working on packaging up the necessary bits which are relatively small.
