In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-10-19..2015-10-26+user%3Aservo),
we landed 88 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We have TWO new reviewers this week! [Eli Friedman](https://github.com/eefriedman) has been doing fantastic work reviewing some DOM/Content-related
PRs and we're looking forward to burdening them with even more in the future!

[Michael Wu](https://github.com/michaelwu/), the originator of our Gonk port (aka, Boot2Servo) and frequent hacker on our SpiderMonkey integration,
has also been granted reviewer priviledges.
