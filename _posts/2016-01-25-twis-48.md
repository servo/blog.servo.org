In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-01-11..2016-01-25+user%3Aservo), we landed 130 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

After months of work by vlad and many others, Windows support [landed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/9385)! Thanks to everyone who contributed fixes, tests, reviews, and even encouragement (or impatience!) to help us make this happen.
