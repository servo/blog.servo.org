In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-11-16..2015-11-30+user%3Aservo),
we landed 165 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The huge news from the last two weeks is that after some really serious efforts from across the team and community to handle the `libc` changes required, we've [upgraded](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8446) Rust compiler versions! This change is more exciting than usual because it switches us from our custom Rust compiler and onto the nightlies produced by the Rust team. The following [upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8698) was really quick!

Now that we have separate support for making `try` builds, we have added dzbarsky, ecoal95, KiChjang, ajeffrey, and waffles. Please nominate your local friendly contributor today!

###Meetings

At the [meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-11-16) two weeks ago we discussed intermittent test failures, using a mailing lists vs. discourse, the libcpocalypse, and our E-Easy issues. There was no meeting last week.
