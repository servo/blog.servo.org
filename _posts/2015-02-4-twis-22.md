This week, we merged 66 pull requests

It's Servo's third Github-birthday! The repository was created on 5 February, 2012, though the first commit was three days after that.

No birthday is complete without food. Servo got [cookie support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4519) today!

Josh also gave a talk on contributing to Servo at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/speaker/josh_matthews/). The video isn't up yet, but you can find the slides [here](http://www.joshmatthews.net/fosdem2015/).

###Notable additions

 - Josh and Shamir added [cookie support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4519) to Servo. Now you can log in to Github and some other sites. Reddit doesn't work yet, however.
 - Manish added support for [SSL certificate validation](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4741) via OpenSSL. [Your certificate is bad, and you should feel bad](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B66rwGfCcAEe9Ki.png:large)
 - We landed a [Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4719)!
 - Yodalee added [form submission support for buttons](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4729)
 - Ms2ger [switched some of our DOM pointers to use `NonZero<T>`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4787)
 - Arpad added [compile-time lowercasing as a syntax extension](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4815) and switched our DOM macros to use it
 - Gilles [refactored event code to avoid mixing up the trustedness](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4706)
 - Glenn removed our [GLFW version](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4798). We now use [glutin](https://github.com/tomaka/glutin) on both Linux and OS X.

###Screenshots

With cookie support, we can finally see what websites look whilst logged in!

Due to various bugs we can only log in and browse around, but not actually post anything on these sites. Hopefully they should get fixed soon. We're also looking into fixing login support for Reddit, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.

If you want to try this out out, it should work on master, however if you're on Linux currently special characters and numbers [don't work](https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/issues/251#issuecomment-72956139), so you'll have to tweak the code [here](http://mxr.mozilla.org/servo/source/components/script/dom/htmlformelement.rs#192) to do some string replacements.
