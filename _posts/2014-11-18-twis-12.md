###Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-11-17)

 - We planned for the upcoming December work week.
 - We now build for Android on the buildbots, though there aren't any tests yet. We'll be getting ARM servers in the cloud and a Nexus 9 for testing once we get cross-compilation working. QEMU was discussed as an alternative
 - CEF is almost completely filled out, though the rust upgrade broke it. There are some issues to be discussed regarding string encodings and CEF.
 - We're having some [logo proposals](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/3893)
 - The transition to an out-of-tree libgreen and IO was discussed.
 - Critic (our review tool) has problems with rebases, which breaks the usual PR workflow. How do we deal with this?
