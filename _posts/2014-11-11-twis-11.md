This week, we landed 25 pull requests.


[This Week In Rust is back!](http://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2014/11/10/this-week-in-rust-56/) If you haven't already, you should check it out!

Last week there were many talks on Servo. Lars gave [a general intro to Servo](https://air.mozilla.org/an-introduction-to-servo/), and there were four talks on Servo during the [Bay Area Rust meetup](https://air.mozilla.org/bay-area-rust-meetup-november-2014/) by Matt, Patrick, Keegan, and Josh.



###Notable additions
 - Patrick [micro-optimized `DList` and `StackingContext`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3890)
 - Ms2ger implemented [`HTMLElement.title`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3901/) and [`HTMLElement.lang`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3914/), and made [another prefix fix](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3905)
 - Patrick [implemented a subset of CSS linear gradients](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3696)
 - Glenn [improved media queries](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3886)
 - Mukilan [made another XHR fix](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3917)
 - Manish [documented the plugins crate and improved compile-time rooting checks](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3903)
 - Bruno [implemented `DOMStringMap`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3884)

###Statistics

You can find some cool commit stats [here](http://www.joshmatthews.net/servo-stats.html).

We also have some stats on CSS property usage [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CxLS8w8GwK-2euVErrqpUUb76PiZa6w5h5EnGsL9KFs/edit?usp=sharing). More details and caveats on the same can be found [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/iB8fZ7SUS0Q)

 - [Encoding](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Workweek-encoding): UTF16/UTF8/WTF8 upsides and downsides; obtaining relevant perf/usage measurements; let's talk to the SpiderMonkey team. 
 - [Governance](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Workweek-governance): creating a Servo module; are CLAs required; explicit commit access/review powers policy.
 - [Layers](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Workweek-layers2): Iframes and the compositor; coordinate systems in layers; layer hierarchy in compositor; CSS transforms and animations and Gecko's refresh driver; cross-origin iframe security. 
 - [JS Bindings - security/rooting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Workweek-js-bindings-status): (unfocused discussion) - difficulties of ensuring correctness of bindings-related things; rewriting C++ code in Rust; Gecko security bug audits.
 - [Boot to Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Workweek-boot-2-servo): B2G architecture; motivations/goals of b2s; power/performance concerns.
 - [Security](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Workweek-security): Security bug policy; known vulnerabilities; desired security for first nightlies; whitelisting visitable sites.

###Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-11-10)

We assigned action items from the previous work week, and discussed the next one a bit. 

Additionally, we discussed having an autogenerated version of [Patrick's CSS stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CxLS8w8GwK-2euVErrqpUUb76PiZa6w5h5EnGsL9KFs/edit?usp=sharing) to be generated with each PR, and how to handle codegen for supported/unsupported styles post-CSSOM.
