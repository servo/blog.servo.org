This week, we merged 41 pull requests

We now support [100 CSS properties!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CxLS8w8GwK-2euVErrqpUUb76PiZa6w5h5EnGsL9KFs/edit#gid=555855884)

###Notable additions

We landed [another Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4554).  Next up: Rust 1.0 Alpha!

 - Patrick implemented [`word-break`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4529), [`outline-offset`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4525), [`text-rendering`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4523), and [`filter`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4557)
 - Tom [implemented most of the important `WindowProxy` traps](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4594)
 - Ms2ger [turned off the usage of `unsafe` in script aside from a couple of allowed areas](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4584)
 - Edit [connected the Canvas render task to layout](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4137). Simple canvases now work.

We also have working certificate checking in Servo, you can try it on [this branch](https://github.com/Manishearth/servo/compare/cert-checking). The current certificate file only has a single Equifax certificate (so Google will work, but not Wikipedia; this is great for testing), however replacing `resources/certs` with `resources/fullcerts` should get you a full set of root CA certificates.

###Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-01-12)

 - Simon has [refactored the parser](https://github.com/servo/rust-cssparser/pull/68) to be fully incremental and will be updating style code to it soon
 - We had some memory corruption issues (with `mucell`, perhaps?) during the Rust upgrade
 - We should start updating to alpha soon
