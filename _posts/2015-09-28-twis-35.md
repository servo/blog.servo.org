In the [last week](https://github.com/servo/servo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-09-21..2015-09-27),
we landed 37 PRs in the Servo repository!

In addition to a [rustup](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7697) by Manish and a lot of great cleanup, we also saw:
- Glennw fixed a bug where [animations continued forever at full blast](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7724)
- Martin Robinson landed the [first bits](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/7710) of his massive ongoing
stacking context / display list refactoring work

###Meetings

At last week's [meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-09-21), we discussed the outcomes from
the Paris layout meetup, how to approach submodule updates, and trying to reduce the horrible enlistment experience
with downloading Skia.
