In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-11-09..2015-11-16+user%3Aservo),
we landed 106 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We have a [new](https://github.com/servo/servo.org/pull/5) [homepage](https://github.com/servo/servo.org/pull/6), [http://www.servo.org]! Many thanks to nerith and lucywyman!

Prabhjyot Sodhi did some initial analysis of Servo's E-Easy bugs to show how long it is before they are closed - for a large subset of them, it was within 24 hours!
