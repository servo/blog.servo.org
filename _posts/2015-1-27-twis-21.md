This week, we merged 8 pull requests. Not many significant changes this week since people
 were busy with the rustup and we try not to land large changes that need to be rebased over.

Ms2ger reached [his 1000th commit](https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/13c7cf928a5817de315a58a4fa15dc9b7fdc3d7f), and is the first on the project to do so!

###Notable additions

 - The [rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4719) is still going on; it has now reached review.
 - Simon [landed the new CSS parser](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4689)

##Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-01-26)

We discussed setting up CI for our dependencies, whether or not they should all track Rust nightly, and the rust upgrade.
