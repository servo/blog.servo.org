In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-12-21..2015-12-28+user%3Aservo), we landed 25 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories. Given the Christmas holiday, it's not too surprising that the number is a bit lower than usual!

This week brings us some of the first progress on Stylo, which is an effort to make it possible to use Servo's style system within Firefox/Gecko.


###Notable Additions

- ecoal [added](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/182) support for running Servo on Linux over EGL instead of GLX
- bholley [landed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/9004) the first set of Stylo support in Servo
